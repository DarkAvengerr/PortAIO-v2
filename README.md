### - Frequently Asked Questions :
1. What is a port? : A port is code used from another script from a completely different scripting platform and making it compatible in our case, EloBuddy.

2. Does PortAIO support all the champions? : Yes, we support all 131 champions with the last champion being Taliyah (as of 6.14)

3. Will PortAIO ever have BoL scripts? : As of now no, converting code from LUA to C# is fairly difficult but its currently not any where on our agenda.

4. What is a dual-port? : The dual-port feature allows for you to change the port you are using for your champion/utility, as of 6.14 patch the dual-port feature only supports 85 champions and 4 utility scripts.

5. Why is PortAIO not on EB? : The rules forbid ported addons on their forums but when I started this project the rule wasn't present, what does that tell you?

6. Why was this project started? : I had the idea of PortAIO back when there wasn't much developers on EB and I wanted to kick-start the community so I thought of this insanely time-consuming project and just made it happen, also to appeal to the users that want to use L# but don't want to invest in it.
